            <h3 className={`my-1`}>Local Laws; Export Control</h3>

                We control and operate the Services from our headquarters in the United States of America and the entirety of the Services may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you use the Services outside the United States of America, you are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.

            <h3 className={`my-1`}>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <h6 className={`mb-1 text-small4`}>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.</h6>
            <p className={`mb-1`}>
                This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
            </p>
            <p className={`mb-1`}>
                This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). YOU AND mybookingcalendar AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
            </p>
            <h6 className={`mb-1 text-small4`}>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h6>
            <p className={`mb-1`}>
                For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to cure or resolve the dispute which is first done by emailing us at support@mybookingcalendar.com the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.
            </p>
            <h6 className={`mb-1 text-small4`}>Arbitration Procedures</h6>
            <p className={`mb-1`}>
                If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. JAMS, , will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. This provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because these Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. You or we may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the U.S federal judicial district where you are located. 
            </p>
            <h6 className={`mb-1 text-small4`}>Class Action Waiver</h6>
            <p className={`mb-1`}>
                Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and mybookingcalendar specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
            </p>
            <h6 className={`mb-1 text-small4`}>Other</h6>
            <p className={`mb-1`}>
                You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.
